# Installing and Configuring PyKMIP for Encryption at Rest

Encryption at rest, provided by MongoDB EA, uses an external KMIP appliance to manage the master keys. [PyKMIP](https://github.com/OpenKMIP/PyKMIP), an open source implementation of the KMIP protocol, is useful for demonstrating this capability. These scripts install and configure KMIP on either CentOS or Ubuntu systems. The Ubuntu scripts are specifically tailored for the MongoDB Ops Manager demonstration Virtual Machine.
