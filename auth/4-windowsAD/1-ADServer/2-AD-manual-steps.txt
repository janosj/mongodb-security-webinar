The following config steps come from here:
https://rdr-it.com/en/windows-server-2022-installation-of-an-active-directory-domain-controller/

A note on terminology: A domain controller (DC) is any server that is running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). 
At least one domain controller is required.

Install DS Role via Powershell:
  Install-windowsfeature -name AD-Domain-Services â€“IncludeManagementTools

Configuration Steps (after installing the DS role):
(note: on several of these steps, you may have to wait for some background tasks to complete)
  - Launch Server Manager
  - Click notification icon (top-right) > Promote this server to a domain controller
  - Select Add new forest. Specify Root domain: mycompany.local
  - Accept default Domain Controller Options. Specify password, e.g. Password1.
  - At DNS Options, ignore the DNS delegation error and click Next.
  - Wait for the NetBIOS domain name to be generated, then click Next.
  - Accept default Paths (click Next).
  - At Review Options, click Next.
  - Verification should pass successfully. Click Install.
  - Post Installation, the server will restart as a Domain Controller.

Login again using the same decrypted password as before. The account is now <DOMAIN>\Administrator.
Additional tools will now be available via the Windows Launch button.
Launch Active Directory Users and Computers, under Windows Administrative Tools.
Navigate to Users, under your new domain (e.g. mycompany.local).
Create two new users:
  Maple Tree, mapletree@mycompany.local, Password1
  Daisy Flower, daisyflower@mycompany.local, Password1
Clear all check boxes about changing passwords etc.

Active Directory installation and configuration is now complete!
Proceed with the next set of scripts to install and configure a MongoDB database.
